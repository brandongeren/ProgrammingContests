The first programming contest took a bit of getting used to. It was a new way of being tested on Computer Science knowledge. My group members and I first began to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses here. The work was not our best, and I think that later contests show we could have done better.

The ones we completed were 3, 6, and 8.
