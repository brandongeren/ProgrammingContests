This contest was done on March 12, 2016.

This contest showed more accurately than the first two how well my group could do. However, I walked out of it feeling like the result wasn't good enough. I still think that I could do so much more than this. The circles problem was very difficult and I wish that I could claim to have finished it. However, that was the work of one of my group members. He spent around 4 of the 5 alotted hours on this problem, though, so the 4 other solutions were done just by myself and my other group member. We were the first to solve a problem. I saw the Winning Percentage problem and very quickly wrote out a solution and submitted it.

Unfortunately, I cannot find a pdf file of the problem set for this contest.
