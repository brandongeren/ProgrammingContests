# ProgrammingContests
My team's work for programming contests in Honors Data Structures and Algorithms.

Each programming contest is a 5 hour 3-member group experience competing against the other members of the class to solve the problems as quickly as possible. Only one computer is given to each group, so communication is key to make sure that nobody is using the computer for too long when other members' solutions could be written up. The contests also teach how to work independently of one another yet still collaborate and ask each other for help when needed.

Unfortunately for the reader, the programming contest format is not very good for readability. The point is to complete as many problems as possible in 5 hours, so commenting is a bit of a waste of time.  As long as the program makes the right output, you get the points.
